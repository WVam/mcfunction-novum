## [1.16|20w13a] mcfunction language support for atom

# Info
This is a fork of https://github.com/Yurihaia/mcfunction. I have not created the base of this package, all the credits for that goes to Yurihaia, but I know how to edit the package to support the newest commands and items and I will also add quality of life changes. My goal is to keep the package up to date with the latest snapshots, because there is no currently supported version of this package

# [1.17|20w45a] mcfunction language support for atom

## Info
This is a fork of https://github.com/Yurihaia/mcfunction. I have not created the base of this package, all the credits for that goes to Yurihaia, but I know how to edit the package to support the newest commands and items and I will also add quality of life changes. My goal is to keep the package up to date with the latest snapshots.

## Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Autocomplete for commands and selectors
  - Working autocomplete for irregular particles (minecraft:block, minecraft:dust, minecraft:item)
- Version switching (starting from 1.16.2)
- Actively updated lists for:
  - Advancements
  - Blocks
  - Effects
  - Enchantments
  - Entities
  - Items
  - Loottables
  - Particles
  - Recipes
  - Scoreboard objectives
  - Sounds
